# Cosuno Full Stack Recruiting Challenge

This is a simple Nextjs based react webapp. It is built with node.js lambda functions in the backend and a server side prerendered React based frontend. Check out a preview [HERE](https://cosuno-challenge-kolb.netlify.app/)

If I was to develop this further I would add the following features:
* Better tag filtering component with search and autocompletion,
* Pagination for search results,
* Toggle for a more compact view,
* Sorting options for results
* Favorite List (Which would require user management and a proper DB in the backend)
Later: ML based features such as 
* more advanced filtering options that show depending on user profile and search terms
* sorting/highlighting of results based on profitability for the company
